## Summary

I'm passionate about building rich web applications and mobile apps with JavaScript.  I enjoy teaching others and working collaboratively with talented people.  Having worked with many small to medium sized teams over the years I'm comfortable working across the full stack of multiple platforms(Rails, Django, .NET and PHP), my area of expertise is the front-end.

My last role was with [Inspire9 Development](http://development.inspire9.com/), a development agency that worked with early-stage startups and bootstrapped their own app for managing co-working spaces called [Tribes](http://www.pageuppeople.com/).  I also worked with [Adioso](http://www.adioso.com/) for two years and [PageUp People](http://www.pageuppeople.com/) for four years - the leading Australian talent management software provider.  I have been working on the web professionally for over <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear() - 2006)</script> years.

I build working software with simple readable code that's well tested.

I'm also an author of Sitepoint's [JavaScript channel](https://www.sitepoint.com/author/mbrown/).

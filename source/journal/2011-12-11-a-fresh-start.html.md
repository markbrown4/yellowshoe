## Leaving the corporate machine
To put it simply, I ended up feeling a bit like [Peter Gibbons](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/) in Office Space.

People at work were bitter, lazy & unfocused, they lacked leadership.

It was a long time coming, I was tired of working on large corporate projects for large corporate clients.  I wanted to try working in a more creative environment along side people more focused on good design principles.  I feel it will be a more enjoyable work experience and more rewarding also.

And so, I'm branching out into the world of freelance, getting fit & meeting new people. Happy days.
